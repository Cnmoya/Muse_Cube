Initializing
============
Initializing is easy You must be in "ipython --pylab" enviroment/::
        from PyMUSE.musecube import MuseCube
        cube = MuseCube(filename_cube, filename_white)
If for any reason you do not have the white image, you can still initialize the cube just typing/::
        cube = MuseCube(filename_cube)
